This mod allows the creation of paintings which depicts images from a given URL.

Players will be able to access these image paintings through the /painting command which functions as follows:
/painting <URL> <Width> <Height>
<URL>: An URL that links to an image
<Width>: A number specifying the width of the painting ( in blocks )
<Height> A number specifying the height of the painting ( in blocks )

An example of proper command usage would be: /painting https://i.imgur.com/o0xw022.jpeg 12 5
