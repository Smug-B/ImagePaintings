This mod allows the creation of paintings which depicts images from a given URL.

Players will be able to access these image paintings through the /paintingUI command which brings up an UI where players can input data about their desired paintings!

To delete paintings, players must craft a 'Painting Hammer' item through assembling 5 pieces of wood anywhere. Legacy paintings can be broken with a pickaxe.

NOTICE: In regards to GIFs
1) Currently, only Windows support GIF paintings. Sorry Mac and Linux users.
2) They are very memory intensive! Do not play attempt to play God unless you have sufficent amount of memory to use.
3) For those wishing not to load GIFs, there is the new GIF config setting. GIFs will only load their first frame if the setting is disabled.
4) It is highly suggested that you restart your game everytime you save and exit a world.

NOTICE: Bug reports are appreciated! You can do so through making an issue through github, or informing me through discord.
