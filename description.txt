This mod allows the creation of paintings which depicts images from a given URL.

Players will be able to access these image paintings through the /painting command which functions as follows:
/painting <URL> <Width> <Height> <OPTIONAL: Frame Duration> <OPTIONAL: Resolution Size X> <OPTIONAL: Resolution Size Y>
<URL>: An URL that links to an image
<Width>: A number specifying the width of the painting ( in blocks )
<Height>: A number specifying the height of the painting ( in blocks )
<OPTIONAL: Frame Duration>: An optional parameter specifying how long, in ticks ( 1 / 60th of a second ), should each frame of a GIF be played. Defaults to 5 and does nothing on normal paintings.
<OPTIONAL: Resolution Size X>: An optional parameter specifying the resolution ( X ) of the image displayed, useful for reducing reducing the quality of a painting thereby saving memory
<OPTIONAL: Resolution Size Y>: An optional parameter specifying the resolution ( Y ) of the image displayed, useful for reducing reducing the quality of a painting thereby saving memory

An example of the default proper command usage would be: /painting https://i.imgur.com/o0xw022.jpeg 12 5
Another example of proper command usage would be: /painting https://c.tenor.com/7YbmXq_ixXIAAAAd/zhukov.gif 20 12 3 200 120

NOTICE: In regards to GIFs
1) Currently, only Windows support GIF paintings. Sorry Mac and Linux users.
2) They are very memory intensive! Do not play attempt to play God unless you have sufficent amount of memory to use.
3) For those wishing not to load GIFs, there is the new GIF config setting. GIFs will only load their first frame if the setting is disabled.
4) It is highly suggested that you restart your game everytime you save and exit a world.
