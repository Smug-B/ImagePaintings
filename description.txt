This mod allows the creation of paintings which depicts images from a given URL.

Guide:
To start simply type the following command in chat in order to get a painting.
/painting <URL> <X Size> <Y Size>
Note: the X and Y dimensions are in tiles, and both have value cap of 33

The item can only be used on a walled area with adequate space. The painting will spawn from your mouse cursor, with the top left corner being the origin.

Bugs:
In any situation that the painting glitches out and prevents you from placing blocks at a given coordinate:
1. Get another painting using the command above.
2. And at water, craft an Error Potion

When drunk, the error potion should allow you to see painting tiles for manual removal.
